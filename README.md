## 📥 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Web Scraping  
Playwright fetches multiple pages of Flipkart reviews:  
- Username  
- Rating  
- Review title & text  
- Timestamp

Text is cleaned and passed through **VADER** for polarity scoring:  
- Positive  
- Negative  
- Neutral  
- Compound Score  

### 3️⃣ Rating Prediction  
A custom rule-based approach maps sentiment → star rating:  
- Compound < -0.3 → ⭐  
- -0.3 to 0.0 → ⭐⭐  
- 0.0 to 0.3 → ⭐⭐⭐  
- 0.3 to 0.6 → ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
- > 0.6 → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### 4️⃣ Visualization  
Interactive dashboards display:  
- Sentiment pie chart  
- Actual vs Predicted bar graph  
- Confusion matrix  
- Word clouds  

### 5️⃣ Flask Interface  
A simple UI to:  
- Input product link  
- Trigger scraping
